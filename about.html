          <h2>What is this webpage?</h2>
          <p>
            Self‑Care Garden is a simple, playful space where you can breathe,
            reflect, and do tiny actions that support your well‑being.
            It’s not about productivity or perfection — it’s about noticing that
            you showed up at all.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can check in with your mood, try short breathing exercises,
            write what’s on your mind, play low‑pressure mini‑games, and watch
            your “garden” slowly grow as you take care of yourself in small
            ways.

          <h2>Created by KIRDEE</h2>
          <p>
            This project was created with the intention of giving people a
            friendly, low‑pressure place to breathe and be honest with
            themselves. It’s designed to be simple, accessible, and kind —
            especially for days when everything else feels too loud.
          </p>
          <p class="tiny-text">
            The garden will keep evolving over time as more ideas and features
            blossom.
